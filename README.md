# Day Planner
  This is a fancy day planner you want to use. It shows a clock to remind you what time it is now. You could input the tasks you want to finish for each 1hr block, and save it using the 'save' buttons. The planned tasks will remain even after refreshing the webpage. The block showing the current task is in red color, the blocks showing tasks in the past are in yellow, and the future tasks are in green. Go to  https://zkdtc.github.io/day_schedular/ to enjoy~
